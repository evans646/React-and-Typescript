# Getting started
------
- Creating a react application with stypescript support using the create react app CLI
- Comparing project output

we create by typing: 

```npx create-react-app appname --template typescript```

Which creates the app configured with Ts 

The ts config file contains the configuration  of how ts can be used in the  project 

 react Ts CLI options: 
 
- create-next-app
- create-snowpack-app
- gatsby

To add Typscript to existing app, you need to install and configure it within the app :

```yarn add typescript  @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node```

after sintallation you can update  the 

```.js files to have .ts extention eg. App.js => App.ts```

after that : 

```yarn start```

Or npm whichever you prefer
